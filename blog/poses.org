  12 principles just to practice!!I'll have a ton of great ideas with this.

- Timing and spacing.  
  From vts.

- Principles of poses.
  What Ive got from lango plus some research to make sure I diddn't miss anything.

- Types of keys - //Key, breakdown, inbetween.
Breakdown drawing is a drawing that defines how the character gets from one extreme to another extreme!!  


- I can make poses not to just illustrate the emotions, but all of these principles!
- I could animate pendulum for ease in/out!


- Sneak cycle making of.
- Walkcycle tutorial. Break down into short parts, like digital tutors do, edit them together.
  - In this tutorial I will show you... so lets get started. [recorded later] 
  - Load the rig, default pose. Open the reference. Gibal here.
  - Set the keys. Contact and passing. Mirror trick. defaults? //talk on up and down? later.
  - Spread them around the timeline. Set cycles everywhere.
  - Hide the arms, nail the leg motions. 
     Linear when moving backwards, correct ankle loops, correct hip loop.
  - Show the arms, move gimbal(i will explain it in a separate tutorial, for now just..), animate arms.
  - Add hip motions, chest motions, weight shift.
  - Fix knee popping.
  - Add lags.(move toes and wrists 3 keys forward).
  - Render it in flipbook.
